 # MISP + Pi-hole Installation Guide
 
 This README provides step-by-step instructions for installing both **MISP** (Malware Information Sharing Platform) and **Pi-hole** on a Ubuntu-based system (tested on Ubuntu 24.04). The process uses the official installation scripts from each projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
 
 ---
 
 ## Important
 
 - These scripts assume you have **sudo** or **root** privileges.  
 - MISP and Pi-hole each have their own dependencies; ensure your system is up-to-date before proceeding.  
 - If you plan to run both on the **same machine**, verify that there are no port conflicts (e.g., Pi-hole typically runs a DNS service and a web dashboard).  
 - Consult each projectâ€™s official documentation for more advanced configuration.

 ## Run misp-to-pihole.py
Before running script see how many blocked domains you have
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501c419c-ea89-4ad4-b6f1-9937e87167b5)
Now go terminal and run script
 ```bash
chmod +x misp-to-pihole.py

 ```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0410005a-f65b-419f-a5e3-7d23348bc36d)

Add the script to run domains from MISP to Pi-hole every six hours and fetch MISP all enabled feeds:
```
sudo crontab -e
```
Add line using 1 for nano editor (we use one command to get new feeds for MISP and then wait for 5 minutes and then load the domains in to Pi-hole database):
```
0 */6 * * * bash -c 'sudo -u www-data /var/www/MISP/app/Console/cake Server fetchFeed 1 all && sleep 300 && /home/user/misp-to-pihole.py'
```

 ## Run dns_test.py - to measure performance
Dowmload the script:
 ```bash
chmod +x dns_test.py
./dns_test.py
 ```
Clean the database if needed:
```
sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "DELETE FROM domainlist"
```
